  title: My Origin Story

So we all have some sort of story for why it is we do what we do, and this is mine.

My Uncle Paul gave me a computer as a graduation present in 1997. His advice was, "learn how to build websites, and I don't mean with those programs that let you drag and drop things on to the page. Learn how to write the code behind it. Websites are the future, everything will be on the web."

I was raised in a strict religious cult; we didn't even own a television. The list of things I was permitted to learn was very small; with this one gift my world expanded at a rapid rate. I couldn't learn enough, fast enough; creating websites absolutely fascinated me.

These were the days of table-based layouts in Netscape. Like those who were into web development at the same time, I learned from looking at other websites (via "view source"). I built my own Geocities website. I learned how to use FTP. Over the years I learned from CSS Zen Garden, Responsive Web Design, and many more. I have benefitted from, and deeply appreciate, the leaps and bounds we have made in the web development experience itself! Gone are the days when "full-stack developer" was a title bourne from necessity rather than choice.

These days I am primarily focused on collaborative efforts to make the web more accessible; I am an invited expert for the [WAI-ARIA working group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/participants) where I help to shape the specifications related to accessibility on the web. I am also a member of the [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) core team, where I lend my strategic vision to making JavaScript frameworks more accessible.

This June (2022) it will be 25 years since my first "hello world", and I _still_ find building for the web to be a deeply satisfying experience that brings me joy. I can't wait to see what we build next.
