This is Melanie's Explainer, built with [Spacebook](https://spacebook.app) (literally, I forked the repo and added my own content).

Spacebook is simple site generator based on Eleventy, Tailwind 2.0, and Alpine.js.

I know, you are probably asking why I didn't use Ember. I just wanted to try something new and this met my criteria. <3
